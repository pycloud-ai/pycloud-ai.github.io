It translates local Python code into kubernetes cluster with minimal number of extra logic (no more handcrafting yaml files). That allows easy and fast transformation of algorithms/AI code into cloud environment. Because it's fast, it gives flexibility not known before - adjusting architecture/redeployment for better scalability can be done in minutes.
